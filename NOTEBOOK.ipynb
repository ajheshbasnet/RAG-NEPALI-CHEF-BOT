            "Riki Kur is one of our Sherpa communities main traditional dishes back in Nepal, but we enjoy it here in Britain too, especially when we gather together as a community at our homes.   It is filling and gives energy, and is really tasty; great for winter weather in the UK as much as the Himalayan climate.  It is a mainstay Sherpa food enjoyed for centuries and its recipe, as with the accompanying Yak cheese & spring onion achar / pickle, which we use with other traditional dishes too; the cheese, chili, and spring onion complement the pancake's taste, with its blend of potato and butter, itself so well.\n",
            "I first enjoyed it as a very young child, learning from my mother soon after in the family kitchen.  I feel since that time long ago, and settling in the UK, and learning a little about traditional British foods, that there are at least in the Riki Kur itself, some similarities with aspects of Scottish food, and that maybe we can say that terrain and climate do have some influence on the types of food different peoples develop as distinctive to their nutrition needs relating to the lands they live in.\n",

We had 2 types: a veggie version and also a pork version. Both were amazing. They had a very delicate pastry with a full-flavoured filling.\\nA couple week later and I still couldn't get the Momos out my mind, so asked Deepak if he would teach me how to cook them.

            "नमस्ते! (Namaste!) Welcome to my kitchen! I'm thrilled to share with you the art of making delicious Nepali samosas. These crispy, savory pastries are a staple in Nepali cuisine, and I'm excited to guide you through the process.\n",
            "\n",
            "**What are Samosas?**\n",
            "Samosas are a popular Nepali snack or appetizer, typically filled with spiced potatoes, peas, and onions. They're crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, making them a delight to eat.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Ingredients:**\n",
            "\n",
            "For the dough:\n",
            "- 2 cups all-purpose flour\n",
            "- 1 teaspoon salt\n",
            "- 1/4 teaspoon baking powder\n",
            "- 1/4 cup ghee or oil\n",
            "- 1/2 cup lukewarm water\n",
            "\n",
            "For the filling:\n",
            "- 2 large potatoes, boiled and mashed\n",
            "- 1 cup fresh peas\n",
            "- 1 large onion, finely chopped\n",
            "- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds\n",
            "- 1 teaspoon coriander powder\n",
            "- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder\n",
            "- 1/2 teaspoon red chili powder\n",
            "- Salt, to taste\n",
            "- 2 tablespoons ghee or oil\n",
            "\n",
            "**Instructions:**\n",
            "\n",
            "**Step 1: Make the Dough**\n",
            "\n",
            "1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and baking powder.\n",
            "2. Add the ghee or oil and mix until the dough comes together.\n",
            "3. Gradually add the lukewarm water and knead the dough for 5-7 minutes, until it becomes smooth and pliable.\n",
            "4. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Step 2: Prepare the Filling**\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Heat 1 tablespoon of ghee or oil in a pan over medium heat.\n",
            "2. Add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds.\n",
            "3. Add the chopped onion and sauté until it's translucent.\n",
            "4. Add the mashed potatoes, peas, coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Mix well.\n",
            "5. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the filling is heated through.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Step 3: Assemble the Samosas**\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Divide the dough into 8-10 equal portions.\n",
            "2. Roll out each portion into a thin circle, about 3-4 inches in diameter.\n",
            "3. Place a tablespoon of the filling in the center of each circle.\n",
            "4. Fold the dough over the filling to form a triangle or a cone shape, and press the edges together to seal the samosa.\n",
            "5. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Step 4: Fry the Samosas**\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Heat 2-3 inches of oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat.\n",
            "2. When the oil is hot, add a few samosas (do not overcrowd) and fry until they're golden brown, about 3-4 minutes on each side.\n",
            "3. Drain the samosas on paper towels and serve hot.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Tips and Variations:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* You can bake the samosas instead of frying them. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown.\n",
            "* Experiment with different fillings, such as cauliflower, carrots, or paneer (Indian cheese).\n",
            "* Serve the samosas with a side of chutney or raita (a yogurt and cucumber sauce) for a delicious snack.\n",
            "\n",
            "I hope you enjoy making and devouring these delicious Nepali samosas! If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.\n"
